This version contains a copy of a subset of bazel repository (version
2.1.0 at the moment of writing) with certain modifications needed
for Buck.

Incomplete list of changes:
* recursion is allowed
* removed logger from NestedSet (the change is no longer needed,
  since NestedSet no longer depends on flogger)
* heavily changes Attribute and Label classes
* many operations changed to public to be usable outside of the package
* disabled certain tests for features not used in Buck (e. g. serialization)
